        [KSP]
        This moon was especially hard to spot, as it looks just like a pollen grain, particularly when observed through telescopes based near dusty fields.
        Pol was finally discovered when someone decided to write down the location of the pollen, after having given up on yet another failed attempt to be rid of the smudge.
