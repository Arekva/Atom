        Tylo was the first moon of Jool to be discovered by the Kerbal Astronomical Society.
        After many failed attempts to take a flawless picture of Jool to hang on the office walls, it was finally discovered that the wandering white smear was indeed a moon.
        Scientists speculate that the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall and Jool overhead must be “quite something”.
