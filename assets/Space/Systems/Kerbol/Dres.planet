        Dres is a very small planet. It was the first planet considered to be a dwarf. 
        It’s orbit is highly irregular and together with it’s size it took a long time to discover since half the time it was not where scientists expected to find a planet.Due to its nature of frequenting the bad parts of space. 
        This dwarf planet was officially labeled as “Not to be trusted” by the scientific community.
