        The Mun, is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.
        The Mun’s discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. 
        Granted, it didn’t happen all that long ago, but it’s still fair to say Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
